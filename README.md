# Athlete Salary Analysis
 
Program that generates a dataset of professional athletes and analyzes salary trends across leagues.
 
## Description
 
This project uses the Faker library to generate a dataset of professional athletes including their name, league, age, and salary in millions of dollars. The data is stored in a Pandas DataFrame where statistics are calculated. Matplotlib is then used to create visualizations that show how salaries relate to age, how total salary is distributed between leagues, and the average salary by league. The charts are automatically saved as PNG files in a `charts` folder when the program runs.
